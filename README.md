# IDAO Bootcamp contest

This repo containes the notebook with my solution for the [IDAO bootcamp](https://idao.world/bootcamp/) training [contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/idao-2022-bootcamp-insomnia)

The main idea is to predict the missing values with the other columns of the dataset.

To run, just download the notebook and put the csv files in the same folder, the predictions will be saved in `sub.csv` file.

It could be improved by fixing the outlier values, but still was able to achieve a top 5 finish.
